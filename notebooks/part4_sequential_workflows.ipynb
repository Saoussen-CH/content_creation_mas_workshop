    "1. **🆕 SequentialAgent** - Workflow agent that runs sub-agents in order  \n",

    "3. **🆕 Variable Interpolation** - References state using `{{variable}}`  \n",

    "\n",
    "4. **🆕 State Passing Between Agents** - Automatic data flow  \n",
    "   Agent N's output → Agent N+1's input\n",

    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order Matters**: SequentialAgent enforces execution sequence\n",
    "- **Automatic State**: No manual data passing needed\n",
    "- **Clean Interface**: `output_key` + `{{variable}}` = simple state flow\n",
    "- **Composable**: Agents become pipeline stages\n",

    "## 🚀 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now create ordered workflows where data flows automatically between steps! But what if we need **iterative refinement**? What if content needs to be reviewed and improved until it meets quality standards?\n",
