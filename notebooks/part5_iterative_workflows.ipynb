    "### 🆕 NEW CONCEPT: LoopAgent (Workflow Agent)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is LoopAgent?**  \n",
    "> A LoopAgent is a workflow agent that repeatedly executes its sub-agents until either a condition is met or a maximum iteration count is reached. It's designed for processes that need iterative refinement - like improving content quality through successive critique and improvement cycles.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Key Characteristics**:\n",
    "> - Repeats sub-agents multiple times\n",
    "> - Exit conditions: `max_iterations` reached OR `escalate` flag set to `True`\n",
    "> - Useful for quality improvement, optimization, and refinement tasks\n",
    "> - Parameters: `sub_agents`, `max_iterations`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Exit Mechanisms**:\n",
    "> 1. **Fixed iterations**: Loop runs exactly `max_iterations` times\n",
    "> 2. **Conditional exit**: Tool sets `tool_context.actions.escalate = True`\n",
    ">\n",

    "### 🆕 NEW CONCEPT: ToolContext\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is ToolContext?**  \n",
    "> ToolContext is a special parameter that can be added to custom tool functions to access runtime information and control workflow behavior. When a tool function includes `tool_context: ToolContext` as a parameter, ADK automatically passes in a context object that provides access to session state, runtime actions, and other execution details.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **How to Use It**:\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> def my_tool(tool_context: ToolContext, other_param: str):\n",
    ">     # Access session state\n",
    ">     data = tool_context.state\n",
    ">     # Control workflow execution\n",
    ">     tool_context.actions.escalate = True\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Capabilities**:\n",
    "> - Access session state via `tool_context.state`\n",
    "> - Control workflow behavior via `tool_context.actions`\n",
    "> - Get runtime execution context\n",
    "> - Signal special conditions (like loop termination)\n",

    "### 🆕 NEW CONCEPT: tool_context.actions.escalate\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is tool_context.actions.escalate?**  \n",
    "> The `escalate` flag is a special boolean attribute that signals to a LoopAgent that it should terminate immediately, regardless of remaining iterations. When a tool sets `tool_context.actions.escalate = True`, the loop exits after the current agent completes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Usage Pattern**:\n",

    ">     return {\"result\": \"Loop terminated\"}\n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **When to Use**:\n",
    "> - Quality thresholds met (content is good enough)\n",
    "> - Goal achieved (problem solved)\n",
    "> - Condition satisfied (target reached)\n",
    "> - Early termination needed\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **How It Works**:\n",
    "> 1. Agent calls tool that sets `escalate = True`\n",
    "> 2. Current agent completes its execution\n",
    "> 3. LoopAgent detects escalate flag\n",
    "> 4. Loop terminates (even if iterations remain)\n",

    "## 🎉 Recap: What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a powerful step in building autonomous quality improvement systems!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts Introduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🆕 LoopAgent (Workflow Agent)** - Repeats sub-agents until condition met  \n",
    "   📖 [Workflow Agents](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🆕 ToolContext** - Special parameter for runtime control in tools  \n",
    "   Usage: `def my_tool(tool_context: ToolContext):`  \n",
    "   📖 [Tool Context](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🆕 tool_context.actions.escalate** - Terminates loops from within tools  \n",
    "   Usage: `tool_context.actions.escalate = True`  \n",
    "   📖 [Tool Context](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **🆕 Critique-Refine Pattern** - Autonomous quality improvement architecture  \n",
    "   Pattern: Checker Agent → Improver Agent → Loop until quality met\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **🆕 max_iterations Parameter** - Safety limit for loop cycles  \n",
    "   Usage: `LoopAgent(sub_agents=[...], max_iterations=3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Refinement**: Content improves itself through cycles\n",
    "- **Quality Gates**: Threshold-based autonomous approval\n",
    "- **State Overwriting**: `output_key` gets updated each iteration\n",
    "- **Dual Exit Strategy**: max_iterations OR escalate flag\n",
    "- **Self-Improving Systems**: Agents critique and refine their own work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Draft (output_key=\"current_content\")\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Loop (max_iterations=3):\n",
    "  ├─ Check Quality (reads {{current_content}}, output_key=\"quality_feedback\")\n",
    "  │    ↓\n",
    "  └─ Improve (reads {{quality_feedback}})\n",
    "      ├─ If quality met → tool_context.actions.escalate = True → Exit Loop\n",
    "      └─ If not met → output_key=\"current_content\" (overwrites) → Loop again\n",
    "           ↓\n",
    "Present Final Content\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of LoopAgent:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `current_content` variable gets **overwritten** each iteration, allowing the content to evolve organically until it meets quality standards - all autonomously!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now create self-improving workflows! But what if we need **parallel execution**? What if we want to create a blog post, social content, email newsletter, and SEO metadata **all at once**?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Part 6**, we'll learn about **ParallelAgent** - a workflow agent that runs multiple sub-agents concurrently for maximum efficiency!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preview of Part 6 Concepts:\n",
    "- 🆕 ParallelAgent (Workflow Agent)\n",
    "- 🆕 Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern\n",
    "- 🆕 Intake Agent Pattern\n",
    "- 🆕 Session State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "See you in Part 6! 🚀"
