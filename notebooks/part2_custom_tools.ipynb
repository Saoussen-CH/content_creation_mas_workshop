    "1. **`count_words`** - Counts words in a text\n",
    "2. **`calculate_readability_score`** - Calculates how easy the text is to read (Flesch Reading Ease)\n",
    "3. **`generate_hashtags`** - Creates social media hashtags from content\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🆕 NEW CONCEPT: Tool Signatures & Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "> **How Does ADK Understand Tools?**  \n",
    "> The ADK agent examines three key aspects of your function:\n",
    "> 1. **Function name** - Identifies the tool\n",
    "> 2. **Type hints** - Understands parameters (e.g., `text: str`, `count: int`)\n",
    "> 3. **Docstring** - Learns what the tool does and when to use it\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Best Practice**: Write clear, descriptive docstrings that explain the tool's purpose and usage.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 📖 **Reference**: [Tool Performance Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools-custom/performance/)\n",

    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom tools** are Python functions with clear docstrings\n",
    "- **Specialist agents** focus on a single domain with related tools\n",
    "- **Tool design** matters - agents rely on docstrings to choose tools\n",
    "- **Architecture** guides you toward better design patterns\n",

    "\n",
    "We've successfully created a new specialist agent with powerful custom tools, but this\n",
    "leaves us with a new question: We now have **two separate agents** - our `topic_research_agent`\n",
    "from Part 1 and our `content_analyzer_agent`. How do we make them work together as a team?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Part 3**, we will solve this exact problem by building an **Orchestrator** and learning\n",
    "about the powerful **Agent-as-a-Tool** pattern.\n",
