    "## 🎉 Recap: What We've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a major leap forward in building sophisticated AI systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts Introduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🆕 AgentTool Wrapper** - Converts agents into callable tools for other agents  \n",
    "   📖 [Multi-Agent Systems](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **🆕 The Orchestrator Pattern** - Coordinator agent that delegates but doesn't execute  \n",
    "   Pattern: Understand intent → Route to specialist → Present result\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🆕 Multi-Agent Coordination** - Teams of specialized agents working together  \n",
    "   Architecture: User → Orchestrator → Specialists → Results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Break down complex problems into focused agents\n",
    "- **Composition**: Agents become reusable building blocks via AgentTool\n",
    "- **Delegation**: Orchestrator understands intent and routes appropriately\n",
    "- **Stateful Conversations**: Session maintains context across queries\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on its expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User → Orchestrator → (delegates) → Specialist Agents\n",
    "                                    - Topic Research\n",
    "                                    - Content Analyzer  \n",
    "                                    - SEO Optimizer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've successfully built an agent team managed by an orchestrator! But what if one of\n",
    "the tasks requires multiple, **ordered steps**? For example, how do we ensure the agent\n",
    "first researches a topic and then writes content based on that research?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Part 4**, we'll learn how to build these kinds of ordered, multi-step workflows\n",
    "using the **SequentialAgent** - a workflow agent that executes sub-agents in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preview of Part 4 Concepts:\n",
    "- 🆕 SequentialAgent (Workflow Agent)\n",
    "- 🆕 output_key Parameter\n",
    "- 🆕 State Passing Between Agents\n",
    "- 🆕 Variable Interpolation\n",
    "\n",
