We've built an incredible system of agents that can delegate, follow ordered plans, and even iterate to improve quality. Now we tackle a new dimension: **efficiency**.\n\nOur workflows so far have been linear - one step after another. What if we need to perform multiple, independent tasks **at the same time**? Today we'll learn about **ParallelAgent** - a workflow agent that runs sub-agents concurrently for maximum efficiency!\n\n---\n\n## 📚 The Content Creation Studio Playbook Series\n- Part 1: Building Your First AI Agent ✅\n- Part 2: Giving Your Agent Custom Tools ✅\n- Part 3: Building Agent Teams with Agent-as-a-Tool ✅\n- Part 4: Multi-Step Workflows with SequentialAgent ✅\n- Part 5: Building Iterative Workflows with LoopAgent ✅\n- **Part 6: Efficient Workflows with ParallelAgent** (You are here) 🎯\n- Part 7: The Capstone Project\n\n---\n\n## 🎓 New Concepts in This Part\n\nIn Part 6, we'll introduce these **new ADK concepts**:\n\n1. **ParallelAgent** - Workflow agent that runs all sub-agents concurrently\n2. **Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern** - Distribute work to multiple agents, then combine results\n3. **Intake Agent Pattern** - Parse natural language into structured session state\n4. **Session State Management** - Using `tool_context.state` to store workflow data\n\nEach concept will be clearly marked with 🆕 when first introduced!\n\n---"

It's designed for tasks that are independent of each other and don't need to run in a specific order. The ParallelAgent waits for all sub-agents to complete, then makes their outputs available to the next workflow step.\n>\n> **Key Characteristics**:\n> - Runs all sub-agents simultaneously\n> - Each sub-agent works independently\n> - Total execution time = longest single sub-agent (not sum of all!)\n> - Collects all results via `output_key` from each sub-agent\n> - Parameters: `sub_agents` (list of agents to run in parallel)\n>\n> **Efficiency Gains**:\n> - **Sequential**: Agent1 (5s) + Agent2 (5s) + Agent3 (5s) = 15s total\n> - **Parallel**: All 3 agents run together = 5s total (longest one)\n>\n> **When to Use**:\n> - Multiple independent tasks (blog + social + email)\n> - Information gathering from multiple sources\n> - Content creation for different channels\n> - Any scenario where tasks don't depend on each other\n>\n> 📖 **Reference**: [Workflow Agents](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n\n---\n\n### 🆕 NEW CONCEPT: Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern\n\n> **What is Fan-Out/Fan-In?**  \n> Fan-Out/Fan-In is an architectural pattern for parallel processing. **Fan-Out** means distributing a single input to multiple workers that process it simultaneously. **Fan-In** means collecting all those parallel results and combining them into a single output.\n>\n> **Architecture**:\n> ```\n> Single Input (Content Brief)\n>       ↓\n> [Fan-Out] → Distribute to Multiple Agents\n>       ↓\n> Agent1 | Agent2 | Agent3 | Agent4  ← All run in parallel\n>       ↓\n> [Fan-In] → Synthesizer Combines Results\n>       ↓\n> Single Output (Complete Package)\n> ```\n>\n> **Components**:\n> 1. **Input Agent** - Prepares/parses the input (optional)\n> 2. **ParallelAgent** - Fan-out: Distributes work to sub-agents\n> 3. **Specialist Agents** - Process independently in parallel\n> 4. **Synthesizer Agent** - Fan-in: Combines all results\n>\n> **Benefits**:\n> - Massive speed improvements\n> - Scalable (add more parallel agents easily)\n> - Clear separation of concerns\n> - Each specialist focuses on one task\n>\n> **Real-World Example**:\n> Content brief → [Blog Writer | Social Creator | Email Writer | SEO Agent] → Package Synthesizer\n>\n> 📖 **Reference**: [Workflow Agents](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Our Workflow at a Glance\n\nThe system we're building today follows the **Fan-Out/Fan-In** pattern:\n\n```\n                    ┌────────────────┐\n                    │  Content Brief │\n                    └────────┬───────┘\n                             │\n                    ┌────────▼────────┐\n                    │  Intake Agent   │ (Parse Brief)\n                    └────────┬────────┘\n                             │\n                    ┌────────▼────────┐\n                    │ Parallel Agent  │ (Fan Out)\n                    └─┬────────────┬──┘\n                      │            │\n        ┌─────────────┼────────────┼─────────────┐\n        │             │            │             │\n        ▼             ▼            ▼             ▼\n    ┌──────┐     ┌──────┐     ┌──────┐     ┌──────┐\n    │ Blog │     │Social│     │Email │     │ SEO  │\n    │Writer│     │Media │     │Writer│     │ Meta │\n    └───┬──┘     └───┬──┘     └───┬──┘     └───┬──┘\n        │             │            │             │\n        └─────────────┼────────────┼─────────────┘\n                      │\n                      ▼\n              ┌───────────────┐\n              │ Synthesizer   │ (Fan In)\n              └───────┬───────┘\n                      │\n                      ▼\n              ┌───────────────┐\n              │Content Package│\n              └───────────────┘\n```\n\n### The Power of Parallel Execution:\n\nAll four content creators run **simultaneously**!

Create an \"Intake\" Agent to Parse Content Briefs\n\n### 🆕 NEW CONCEPT: Intake Agent Pattern\n\n> **What is the Intake Agent Pattern?**  \n> The Intake Agent Pattern is a design approach where a specialized agent parses natural language input from users and extracts structured parameters that other agents need. Instead of requiring users to provide structured input (JSON, forms, etc.), the intake agent interprets conversational requests and populates session state with the necessary data.\n>\n> **How It Works**:\n> 1. User provides natural language input (e.g., \"Create content about AI for small businesses, friendly tone\")\n> 2. Intake agent analyzes the request\n> 3. Intake agent extracts key parameters (topic, audience, tone, keywords)\n> 4. Intake agent stores parameters in session state via custom tool\n> 5. Subsequent agents read from session state using `{{variable}}` syntax\n>\n> **Benefits**:\n> - **User-friendly**: No structured input required\n> - **Flexible**: Handles various ways of expressing requirements\n> - **Robust**: Can ask clarifying questions if needed\n> - **Separation of concerns**: Parsing logic isolated from execution logic\n>\n> **Implementation**:\n> ```python\n> intake_agent = Agent(\n>     instruction=\"Extract topic, audience, tone, keywords and call update_session_state\",\n>     tools=[update_session_state]\n> )\n> ```\n>\n> 📖 **Reference**: [Multi-Agent Systems](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/)\n\n---\n\n### 🆕 NEW CONCEPT: Session State Management\n\n> **What is Session State?**  \n> Session state (`tool_context.state`) is a key-value store that persists data throughout a conversation session. Tools can read from and write to this state, allowing data to flow between different agents in a workflow without manual parameter passing.\n>\n> **How to Use It**:\n> ```python\n> def my_tool(tool_context: ToolContext, param: str):\n>     # Write to state\n>     tool_context.state['my_key'] = param\n>     \n>     # Read from state\n>     value = tool_context.state.get('my_key')\n> ```\n>\n> **Access in Agent Instructions**:\n> ```python\n> Agent(\n>     instruction=\"Write about: {{my_key}}\"  # Reads from state\n> )\n> ```\n>\n> **Key Characteristics**:\n> - Persists across agent executions within the same session\n> - Accessible via `tool_context.state` in tools\n> - Accessible via `{{variable}}` syntax in instructions\n> - Supports any JSON-serializable data\n>\n> **Use Cases**:\n> - Storing user preferences (tone, audience, keywords)\n> - Passing data between workflow stages\n> - Maintaining context across conversations\n> - Building stateful workflows\n>\n> **Difference from output_key**:\n> - `output_key`: Stores agent's final response text\n> - `tool_context.state`: Stores arbitrary structured data from tools\n>\n> 📖 **Reference**: [Sessions](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/)\n\n---\n\nIn previous parts, we sometimes hardcoded variables. A more robust approach is to have an agent extract information from the user's natural language query. We'll create an `intake_agent` using the Intake Agent Pattern.\n\nFirst, we define a custom tool that saves extracted information to session state:"

This is the power of ParallelAgent.\n\n---\n\n## 🎓 What's Next?\n\nCongratulations! You've mastered all the core workflow patterns in Google ADK:\n- ✅ **Part 1**: Basic Agents with tools\n- ✅ **Part 2**: Custom Function Tools\n- ✅ **Part 3**: Agent Teams (AgentTool, Orchestrator Pattern)\n- ✅ **Part 4**: Sequential Workflows (ordered execution)\n- ✅ **Part 5**: Iterative Workflows (quality loops)\n- ✅ **Part 6**: Parallel Workflows (concurrent execution)\n\nIn **Part 7: The Capstone Project**, we'll combine **ALL** of these patterns into one comprehensive, production-ready Content Creation Studio. We'll build a master system that:\n- Takes natural language content briefs (Intake Pattern)\n- Researches topics with agent teams (AgentTool)\n- Creates drafts through sequential steps (SequentialAgent)\n- Improves quality through iterative loops (LoopAgent)\n- Produces multi-channel content in parallel (ParallelAgent)\n- Manages everything through hierarchical orchestration\n\nThis will be the ultimate demonstration of what you can build with Google ADK - a real-world, production-ready system combining all the patterns you've learned!\n\n### Preview of Part 7 Concepts:\n- 🆕 Hierarchical Orchestration\n- 🆕 Composable Agent Systems\n- 🆕 Production-Ready Architecture\n- 🆕 End-to-End Autonomous Workflows\n\n**See you in Part 7 for the grand finale! 🚀**"
